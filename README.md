[28/10, 7:38‚ÄØpm] Vasanth: Weather Dashboard (HTML Mockup)
A static prototype and visual design of a weather dashboard interface created solely using HTML to establish the basic structure and content layout.
üöÄ Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to create the structural blueprint of a weather dashboard. It demonstrates the use of standard HTML elements to logically organize information, such as:
A main section for the current weather (temperature, condition, location).
A section for a 5-day forecast.
An input area for searching cities.
This serves as the foundation before adding styles (CSS) or dynamic functionality (JavaScript/API integration).
üíª Technologies Used
HTML5: Used for structuring the content of the dashboard.
üìÑ Files and Structure
The project is minimalist and contains the following file:
index.html: The main and only file containing all the structural HTML for the weather dashboard layout.
‚ú® Features (Static/Design Only)
Since this is an HTML-only project, the features are focused on the visual structure:
Clear Layout: Organized sections for current weather, search bar, and forecast cards.
Semantic HTML: Use of appropriate tags (<header>, <main>, <section>, <div>) to define content roles.
Placeholder Data: Contains hardcoded, static weather information to demonstrate the intended final look.
Accessibility Foundation: Provides a basis for good accessibility through proper element use.
‚û°Ô∏è Getting Started
To view this static dashboard structure:
[28/10, 7:38‚ÄØpm] Vasanth: git clone [https://github.com/veniisha33-code/Dashboard-.git]
[28/10, 7:38‚ÄØpm] Vasanth: Open the file: Locate the index.html file in your project folder.
[28/10, 7:39‚ÄØpm] Vasanth: View in browser: Double-click index.html or drag the file into your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) to view the structure.
[28/10, 7:39‚ÄØpm] Vasanth: Next Steps
This project is intended to be a foundational step. Future development would involve:
Styling (CSS): Adding colors, fonts, and responsiveness to make the dashboard visually appealing.
Functionality (JavaScript): Integrating a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) to fetch and display real-time weather data.
